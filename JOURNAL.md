## 10/18/2025 - Planning & Scouting Stage  

Before I begin Pathfinder MK IV, I need to carefully plan out what it's going to have (and mainly why MK III failed).

The primary flaws with MK III were:

-  The buck converters (along with their passives) are very hard to design well and have a high failure chance.
-  Mismatch between footprints and the actual components led to difficult soldering or reordering
- MCU is bulky, and the connection method was unreliable -> led to unusable damage.
- Not enough safety measures and connections were placed too close together -> leading to shorts and difficult debugging.
- Design was not proof checked / only used DRC, not checked by others.
- GND pour/copper underneath the NRF transmitter antenna.
- Many, close-packed, small SMD components -> hard to solder & easy to make mistakes.
- Plugging in the battery to the XT60 connector immediately powered the device -> hard, unsafe, unreliable to quickly disable.
- 4 layers instead of 2 added extra costs.
- Needs "signs of life" LEDS.

Improvements for MK IV:

- Smaller, not removed MCU, such as Teensy instead of bulky Nucleo.
- I'll need an MP1584EN (everything already built) Buck converter for the teensy itself.
- "signs of life" LEDs
- No GND pour beneath sensitive devices such as the NRF, MCU, and BNO.
- No closely packed SMD components.
- Generally smaller board size but more spread out components (switching from nucleo will allow this).
- On/Off switch connected to battery connector.
- 6-7 volt battery instead of a 7.4v battery to allow direct connection to servos, bypassing the need for buck converters.
- Generally, simple through-hole components instead of SMD.
- More capacitors to smooth out the current.
- Stronger Femur Servos.


Update: just realised that the Teensy 4.1 can't handle 6.6v, needs a buck converter, and on top of that, needs some sort of voltage divider. I'm trying to find documentation / a user manual for the Teensy 4.1, but haven't been successful. I at least found the schematic for it.

Planned list of components for MK IV:

- Teensy 4.1 -> MCU
- 6.6V Battery -> Power
- Switch for Batt to everything -> Safety
- NRF24IO1+ Board for communication
- BNO055 for Yaw Pitch and Roll
- Capacitors to smooth current
- LEDs to show life
- Backup connection methods for components in case of failure
- Pins that expose 5V and 3.3V
- (potentially) ESP32 camera modules.

Time to start KiCad!

Update: I'm spending so much time trying to figure out the battery situation. I currently have 7.4v Lipos, but those could burn out the servos without a buck converter. The main issue is finding a good battery, that isn't too heavy, that has the right voltage AND discharge rate for 18 servos.

Also, I might switch out the 6 Femur servos from Mg996rs to DS32xx.

I found a good battery:

## 10/19/2025 - Making the Schematic  

I'm starting by routing the NRF Chip, then the BNO055

I'm having a bit of trouble with the CE and CSN point on the NRF, there isn't a designated pin on the Teensy for it. After asking google, I think I should connect CSN to a random CS pin and CE to any GPIO.

![card11a_rev3_web.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzUyOSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--a717ea1e85e8d4382817f7fbd447d5b3d34cfee7/card11a_rev3_web.png)
^^ This image is very helpful for figuring out pinouts.

For the power system, I'm going to do an approach similar to Aecert's hexapod's power system. Battery in connects to a switch, which has three primary connections: 
 - first, connection to a buck converter breakout board (to supply the teensy with 5V), 
 - next, the battery output goes through a voltage divider and into an analog pin (to read voltage) (there's also a 3v3 rapid dropout zener diode next to it in case of voltage spikes). I made the primary resisors of the voltage divider THT, but also added pads underneath so I *could* also use SMD (or vice versa).
 - finally, there's the servo motor power line with 2 16v 1500uf electrolytic capacitors for current smoothing.

I spent a lot of time figuring out the voltage divider, and more specifically, what resistance the resistors should be.
Note: I also had to learn what a zener diode does; it seems incredibly useful. 

Update: did a lil more work, think I'll stop here.
