## 10/18/2025 - Planning & Scouting Stage  

Before I begin Pathfinder MK IV, I need to carefully plan out what it's going to have (and mainly why MK III failed).

The primary flaws with MK III were:

-  The buck converters (along with their passives) are very hard to design well and have a high failure chance.
-  Mismatch between footprints and the actual components led to difficult soldering or reordering
- MCU is bulky, and the connection method was unreliable -> led to unusable damage.
- Not enough safety measures and connections were placed too close together -> leading to shorts and difficult debugging.
- Design was not proof checked / only used DRC, not checked by others.
- GND pour/copper underneath the NRF transmitter antenna.
- Many, close-packed, small SMD components -> hard to solder & easy to make mistakes.
- Plugging in the battery to the XT60 connector immediately powered the device -> hard, unsafe, unreliable to quickly disable.
- 4 layers instead of 2 added extra costs.
- Needs "signs of life" LEDS.

Improvements for MK IV:

- Smaller, not removed MCU, such as Teensy instead of bulky Nucleo.
- I'll need an MP1584EN (everything already built) Buck converter for the teensy itself.
- "signs of life" LEDs
- No GND pour beneath sensitive devices such as the NRF, MCU, and BNO.
- No closely packed SMD components.
- Generally smaller board size but more spread out components (switching from nucleo will allow this).
- On/Off switch connected to battery connector.
- 6-7 volt battery instead of a 7.4v battery to allow direct connection to servos, bypassing the need for buck converters.
- Generally, simple through-hole components instead of SMD.
- More capacitors to smooth out the current.
- Stronger Femur Servos.


Update: just realised that the Teensy 4.1 can't handle 6.6v, needs a buck converter, and on top of that, needs some sort of voltage divider. I'm trying to find documentation / a user manual for the Teensy 4.1, but haven't been successful. I at least found the schematic for it.

Planned list of components for MK IV:

- Teensy 4.1 -> MCU
- 6.6V Battery -> Power
- Switch for Batt to everything -> Safety
- NRF24IO1+ Board for communication
- BNO055 for Yaw Pitch and Roll
- Capacitors to smooth current
- LEDs to show life
- Backup connection methods for components in case of failure
- Pins that expose 5V and 3.3V
- (potentially) ESP32 camera modules.

Time to start KiCad!

Update: I'm spending so much time trying to figure out the battery situation. I currently have 7.4v Lipos, but those could burn out the servos without a buck converter. The main issue is finding a good battery, that isn't too heavy, that has the right voltage AND discharge rate for 18 servos.

Also, I might switch out the 6 Femur servos from Mg996rs to DS32xx.

I found a good battery:

## 10/19/2025 - Making the Schematic  

I'm starting by routing the NRF Chip, then the BNO055

I'm having a bit of trouble with the CE and CSN point on the NRF, there isn't a designated pin on the Teensy for it. After asking google, I think I should connect CSN to a random CS pin and CE to any GPIO.

![card11a_rev3_web.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzUyOSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--a717ea1e85e8d4382817f7fbd447d5b3d34cfee7/card11a_rev3_web.png)
^^ This image is very helpful for figuring out pinouts.

For the power system, I'm going to do an approach similar to Aecert's hexapod's power system. Battery in connects to a switch, which has three primary connections: 
 - first, connection to a buck converter breakout board (to supply the teensy with 5V), 
 - next, the battery output goes through a voltage divider and into an analog pin (to read voltage) (there's also a 3v3 rapid dropout zener diode next to it in case of voltage spikes). I made the primary resisors of the voltage divider THT, but also added pads underneath so I *could* also use SMD (or vice versa).
 - finally, there's the servo motor power line with 2 16v 1500uf electrolytic capacitors for current smoothing.

I spent a lot of time figuring out the voltage divider, and more specifically, what resistance the resistors should be.
Note: I also had to learn what a zener diode does; it seems incredibly useful. 

Update: did a lil more work, think I'll stop here.

## 10/25/2025 - More routing & configuring servo lines  

(vvv this is a pinout diagram of the teensy)
![card11a_rev3_web (1)](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTUwNSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--8ef85575918a25a0fb8935f5ae6ac86b2b4d0119/card11a_rev3_web%20(1).png)
^I used this diagram by PJRC to figure out the routing.

Since there's >9 PWM pins on either side of the Teensy, I think I'll have the Teensy be vertical on the PCB and have rows of servo pins either side.

The pinouts I decided were:
Leg 1: Top Left
- Coxa: 0
- Femur: 1
- Tibia: 2
Leg 2: Mid Left
- Coxa: 3
- Femur: 4
- Tibia: 5
Leg 3: Bot Left
- Coxa: 6
- Femur: 7
- Tibia: 8
Leg 4: Bot Right
- Coxa: 37
- Femur: 36
- Tibia: 33
Leg 5: Mid Right
- Coxa: 18
- Femur: 15
- Tibia: 14
Leg 6: Top Right
- Coxa: 23
- Femur: 22
- Tibia: 19

I had trouble finding the left side PWM pins. ![Screenshot 2025-10-25 at 12.34.22 PM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTUyMSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--7e952e8997a92028c96226a674f62b1e17c8534b/Screenshot%202025-10-25%20at%2012.34.22%E2%80%AFPM.png)
Notice how the pins 2-12 either aren't listed on the schematic or have a different pin title?
This is made harder by the teensy not having a user manual for which pins are essential to leave open.

![Screenshot 2025-10-25 at 1.13.10 PM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTU0MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--09781e29d8cd2e758c393e6e21a7e038cf5fc20b/Screenshot%202025-10-25%20at%201.13.10%E2%80%AFPM.png)
I added two push buttons that can short the PROGRAM and ON/OFF pins to GND. Supposedly, if PROGRAM is connected to GND for 15 seconds, the default blink script is loaded. Also, if ON/OFF is connected to GND for 5 seconds, the Teensy turns off and waits for another GND connection.

I'm currently considering whether (and more importantly how) to use TOF sensors on it.
